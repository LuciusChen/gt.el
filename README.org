This is a translation framework on Emacs, with high configurability and extensibility.

[[README-zh.org][点击查看《中文版文档》]]

As a translation framework, it offers many advantages:
- Supports multiple translation engines, including Bing, Google, DeepL, YoudaoDict, StarDict and more.
- Rich rendering components, such as rendering to Buffer, Posframe, Overlay, Kill Ring, and others.
- Flexible retrieval of content and language for translation, with the help of the built-in Taker component.
- Support for word and sentence translation, as well as translation of multiple paragraphs. It can use multiple engines concurrently to translate multiple paragraphs into multiple languages.
- Support for different HTTP backends (url.el, curl) with asynchronous and non-blocking requests, providing a smooth user experience.
- Implemented based on eieio (CLOS), allowing users to flexibly configure and extend the various components.

It's more than just a translation framework.

It's flexible, and can easily be extended to various Text-to-Text conversion scenarios, such as ChatGPT and so on.

** Basic Usage

First, you need to download and load this package via MELPA or other ways.

For the most basic use, add the following code to the configuration file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-langs '(en fr))
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator :engines (gt-google-engine)))

  ;; This configuration means:
  ;; Initialize the default translator, let it translate between en and fr via Google Translate,
  ;; and the result will be displayed in the Echo Area.
#+end_src

Then select a certain text, and start translation with command =gt-do-translate=.

That's it.

Of course, it is possible to specify more options for the translator, such as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker   (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)  ; config the Taker
         :engines (list (gt-bing-engine) (gt-google-engine)) ; specify the Engines
         :render  (gt-buffer-render)))                       ; config the Render

  ;; This configuration means:
  ;; Initialize the default translator, let it send all paragraphs in the buffer to DeepL and Google,
  ;; and output the results with a new Buffer.
#+end_src

Except config default translator with =gt-default-translator=, you can define several preset translators with =gt-preset-translators=.

The first translator in =gt-preset-translators= will be used as the default one if =gt-default-translator= is nil.

The preset translators are defined like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-preset-translators
        `((ts-1 . ,(gt-translator
                    :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'word)
                    :engines (gt-bing-engine)
                    :render (gt-overlay-render)))
          (ts-2 . ,(gt-translator
                    :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr ru) :text 'sentence)
                    :engines (gt-google-engine)
                    :render (gt-insert-render)))
          (ts-3 . ,(gt-translator
                    :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'buffer
                                     :pick 'word :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 6)))
                    :engines (gt-google-engine)
                    :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'help-echo)))))
#+end_src

This configuration presets three translators:
- *ts-1*: translate word or selected region near the cursor between =en= and =fr= via Bing, display the translated result with Overlay
- *ts-2*: translate sentence or selected region near the cursor between =en=, =fr= and =ru= via Google, insert the translated result into current buffer
- *ts-3*: translate all words with length more than 6 in buffer between =en= and =fr= via Google, display the translated result with help echo

Then, translate with command =gt-do-translate= and switch between preset translators with command =gt-do-setup=.

#+begin_quote
*highly recommended:*

Install the curl program and the [[https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el][plz.el]] package. The request will then be sent through curl, which is much better than the built-in url.el!
#+end_quote

See more configuration options via =M-x customize-group go-translate=, and read the following chapters for more configuration details.

** More configurations

The core component of the translation framework is =gt-translator=, which contains the following components:
- =gt-taker=: used to capture user input, including text and languages to be translated
- =gt-engine=: used to translate the content captured by the taker into the corresponding target text
- =gt-render=: used to aggregate results from engines and output them to the user

The flow of translation is =[Input] -> [Translate/Transform] -> [Output]=, corresponding to the components =[Taker] -> [Engine] -> [Render]= above.
Executing the method =gt-start= on the translator will complete a full translation flow.

Therefore, the essence of configuration is to create a translator instance and specify different components according to needs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; specify components with ':taker' ':engines' and ':render'; start translation with 'gt-start'
  (gt-start (gt-translator :taker ... :engines ... :render ...))

  ;; command 'gt-do-translate' use the translator defined in 'gt-default-translator' to do its job
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator :taker ... :engines ... :render ..))
  (call-interactively #'gt-do-translate)
#+end_src

Therefore, one needs to understand these components first for better configuration.

| text      | Initial text                                          | String or a function that returns a string, it can also be symbol like 'buffer 'word 'paragraph 'sentence etc                 |
| langs     | Translate languages                                   | List as '(en fr), '(en ru it fr), if empty, use the value  of gt-langs instead                                                |

| pick      | Pick paragraphs, sentences or words from initial text | Function or a symbol like 'word 'paragraph 'sentence etc                                                                      |
| pick-pred | Used to filter the text picked                        | Pass in a string and output a Boolean type                                                                                    |
| then      | The logic to be executed after take. Hook             | A function that takes the current translator as argument. The final modification can be made to the content captured by Taker |

Currently there is only one built-in Taker implementation, which can be used in most scenarios:
: Determine the initial text with 'text',
: determine the translation languages with 'langs',
: confirm with 'prompt', 
: and extract certain paragraphs, sentences, or words with 'pick'.

If no Taker is specified or if Taker is specified but lacks options, the values ​​of the following variables will be used as default:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-langs '(en fr))        ; Default translation languages, at least two ​​must be specified
  (setq gt-taker-text 'word)      ; By default, the initial text is the word under the cursor. If there is active region, the selected text will be used first
  (setq gt-taker-pick 'paragraph) ; By default, the initial text will be split by paragraphs. If you don't want to use multi-parts translation, set it to nil
  (setq gt-taker-prompt nil)      ; By default, there is no confirm step. Set it to t or 'buffer if needed
#+end_src

It's better to use =:taker= to explicitly specify a Taker for the translator:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker))
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'word :pick 'paragraph :prompt nil))
  (gt-translator :taker (lambda () (gt-taker))) ; a function
#+end_src

Taker will use =text= to determine the initial text. If there is active region, the selected text is taken. Otherwise use the following rules:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; It can be a symbol, then use logic like 'thing-at-thing' to take the text
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'word))      ; current word (default)
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer))    ; current buffer
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph)) ; current paragraph
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text t))          ; interactively choose a symbol, then take by the symbol

  ;; If it's a string or a function that returns a string, use it as the initial text
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text "hello world"))                        ; just the string
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text (lambda () (buffer-substring 10 15)))) ; the returned string
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text (lambda () '((10 . 15)))))             ; the returned bounds 
#+end_src

Taker determine the languages to translate from =langs= in the help of =gt-lang-rules=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr)))    ; between English and French
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr ru))) ; between English, French and Russian
  (setq gt-polyglot-p t) ; If this is t, then multilingual translation will be performed, i.e., translated into multiple languages ​​at once and the output aggregated
#+end_src

By setting =prompt= to allow the user to modify and confirm the initial text and languages interactively:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Confirm by minibuffer
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :prompt t))

  ;; Confirm by new buffer
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :prompt 'buffer))
#+end_src

Finally, the initial text is cut and filtered based on =pick= and =pick-pred=. The content it returns is what will ultimately be translated:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; It can be a symbol like those used by text slot
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker ; translate all paragraphs in the buffer
                         :text 'buffer
                         :pick 'paragraph))
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker ; translate all words longer than 6 in the paragraph
                         :text 'paragraph
                         :pick 'word :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 6))))

  ;; It can be a function. The following example is also translating words longer than 6 in current paragraph.
  ;; More complex and intelligent pick logic can be implemented
  (defun my-get-words-length>-6 (text)
    (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (bd) (> (- (cdr bd) (car bd)) 6))
                      (gt-pick-items-from-text text 'word)))
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :pick #'my-get-words-length>-6))
#+end_src

The built-in Engine implementations are:
- =gt-engine-deepl=, DeepL Translate
- =gt-engine-bing=, Bing Translate
- =gt-engine-google/gt-engine-google-rpc=, Google Translate
- =gt-engine-youdao=, 有道翻译
- =gt-engine-stardict=, StarDict，for offline translate

Specify engines for translator via =:engines=. A translator can have one or more engines, or you can specify a function that returns the engines:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines (gt-google-engine))
  (gt-translator :engines (list (gt-google-engine) (gt-deepl-engine)))
  (gt-translator :engines (lambda () (gt-google-engine)))
#+end_src

If a engine has multiple parsers, you can specify one through =parse= to achieve specific parsing, such as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines
                 (list (gt-google-engine :parse (gt-google-parser))           ; detail results
                       (gt-google-engine :parse (gt-google-summary-parser)))) ; brief results
#+end_src

You can use =if= to filter the engines for current translation task. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines
                 (list (gt-google-engine :if 'word)                      ; Enabled only when translating a word
                       (gt-bing-engine :if '(and not-word parts))        ; Enabled only when translating single part sentence
                       (gt-deepl-engine :if 'not-word :cache nil)        ; Enabled only when translating sentence; disable cache
                       (gt-youdao-dict-engine :if '(or src:fr tgt:fr)))) ; Enabled only when translating French
#+end_src

You can specify different caching policies for different engines with =cache=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines
                 (list (gt-youdao-dict-engine)       ; use default cacher
                       (gt-google-engine :cache nil) ; disable cache
                       (gt-bing-engine :cache 'word) ; cache for word only
                       (gt-deepl-engine :cache (gt-xxx-cacher)))) ; use specify cacher
#+end_src

Engines that need network are derived from =gt-web-engine=, use =hc= to specify http client for them:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator
   :engines (list (gt-google-engine)                          ; no specify, use default http client
                  (gt-bing-engine :hc (gt-plz-http-client)))) ; use the specified http client
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*Notice:*

If translate multiple parts text, the default strategy is:
1. join the parts into a single string,
2. translate the whole string through the engine,
3. then split the result into parts.

The text passed to the Engine for translation should be a single string.

If delimiter is set to nil, then a list of strings will be passed to the engine, and the engine should have the ability to process the string list.

| then   | Logic to be executed after rendering is complete. Hook | function or another Render. The rendering task can be passed to the next Render to achieve the effect of multi-renders output |

The built-in Render implementations:
- =gt-render=, the default implementation, will output the results to Echo Area
- =gt-buffer-render=, open a new Buffer to render the results (*recommended*)
- =gt-posframe-pop-render=, open a childframe at the current position to render the results
- =gt-posframe-pin-render=, use a childframe window with fixed position on the screen to render the results
- =gt-insert-render=, insert the results into current buffer
- =gt-overlay-render=, displays the results through Overlay
- =gt-kill-ring-render=, save the results to Kill Ring
- =gt-alert-render=, display results as system notification with the help of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] package

Configure render for translator via =:render=. Multiple renders can be chained together with =:then=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :render (gt-alert-render))
  (gt-translator :render (gt-alert-render :then (gt-kill-ring-render))) ; display as system notification then save in kill ring
  (gt-translator :render (lambda () (if buffer-read-only (gt-buffer-render) (gt-insert-render)))) ; a function return render
#+end_src

** Components (Supplementary Notes)
*** gt-taker

If prompt via minibuffer, the following keys exist in minibuffer:
- =C-n= and =C-p= switch languages
- =C-l= clear input
- =C-g= abort translate

If prompt via buffer, the following keys exist in the taking buffer:
- =C-c C-c= submit translate
- =C-c C-k= abort translate
- Other keys like switch languages and components please refer to tips on buffer mode line

*** gt-memory-cacher

This is the built-in cache implementation. Just set =gt-cache-p= to t to use it.

You can configure the cacher or switch to another cacher by setting =gt-default-cacher=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-default-cacher (gt-memory-cacher :if 'word)) ; just cache for word
  (setq gt-default-cacher (gt-memory-cacher :if '(or word src:en))) ; just cache for word or english
  (setq gt-default-cacher (gt-xxxxxx-cacher)) ; use other cacher
#+end_src

Set =gt-cache-p= to nil to turn off all caches. Or turn off the cache for engine individually like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines (gt-google-engine :cache nil))
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Translation results can be cached in files, SQLite or Redis through extensions. But maybe it's unnecessary.
#+end_quote

*** gt-plz-http-client

Some engines need to fetch translation results over the network, which requires network processing with the help of the =gt-http-client= component.

By default, use =gt-url-http-client= as the http client, that is, request is sent by =url.el=, which is inefficient.
This component uses =curl= to send the request, which is much better.

Make sure that =curl= is exists and package [[https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el][plz]] is installed. Then the component =gt-plz-http-client= becomes the default http client.

To make =gt-plz-http-client= use proxy, config like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-default-http-client
        (gt-plz-http-client :args '("--proxy" "socks5://127.0.0.1:9999")))
#+end_src

If only some engines need proxy, set individually like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq my-hc-1 (gt-plz-http-client :args '("--proxy" "socks5://127.0.0.1:9999")))
  (gt-translator :engines (list (gt-bing-engine)                ; use default http client
                                (gt-youdao-dict-engine :hc (gt-plz-http-client)) ; no proxy
                                (gt-google-engine :hc my-hc-1)  ; use proxy
                                (gt-deepl-engine :hc my-hc-1))) ; use proxy
#+end_src

*** gt-deepl-engine

DeepL requires =auth-key= to work, please obtained it through the official website.

The =auth-key= can then be set in the following ways:

1. Specify directly in the engine definition:

   #+begin_example
   (gt-translator :engines (gt-deepl-engine :auth-key "***"))
   #+end_example

2. Save it in =.authinfo= file of OS:

   #+begin_example
   machine api.deepl.com login auth-key password ***
   #+end_example

*** gt-buffer-render

Display the translation results with a new buffer. This is a very general way of displaying results.

In the result buffer, there are many shortcut keys (overview through =?=), such as:
- Switch languages via =t=
- Switch multi-language mode via =T=
- TTS via =y=
- Clear caches with =C=
- Refresh via =g=
- Quit via =q=

You can set the buffer window through =buffer-name/window-config/split-threshold=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :render (gt-buffer-render
                          :buffer-name "abc"
                          :window-config '((display-buffer-at-bottom))
                          :then (lambda (_) (pop-to-buffer "abc"))))
#+end_src

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Capture content under cursor, use Google to translate word, use DeepL to translate sentence, use Buffer to display the results
  ;; This is a very practical configuration
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'word)
         :engines (list (gt-google-engine :if 'word) (gt-deepl-engine :if 'not-word))
         :render (gt-buffer-render)))

  ;; A command for translating multiple paragraphs in the Buffer into multiple languages ​​and rendering into new Buffer
  ;; This shows the use of translation of multi-engines with multi-paragraphs and with multi-languages
  (defun demo-translate-multiple-langs-and-multiple-parts ()
    (interactive)

*** gt-posframe-pop-render/gt-posframe-pin-render

You need to install [[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]] before you use these renders.

The effect of these two Renders is similar to =gt-buffer-render=, except that the window is floating.
The shortcut keys are similar too, such as =q= to quit.

*** gt-insert-render

Insert the translation results into current buffer.

The following types can be specified (=type=):
- =after=, the default type, insert the results after the cursor
- =replace=, replace the translated source text with the results

If not satisfied with the default output format and style, adjust it with the following options:
- =sface=, propertize the source text with this face after the translation is complete
- =rfmt=, the output format of the translation result
- =rface=, specify a specific face for the translation results

The option =rfmt= is a function or a string containing the control character =%s=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; %s is a placeholder for translation result
  (gt-insert-render :rfmt " [%s]")
  ;; One argument, that is the translation result
  (gt-insert-render :rfmt (lambda (res) (concat " [" res "]")))
  ;; Two arguments, the first one is the source text
  (gt-insert-render :rfmt (lambda (stext res)
                            (if (length< stext 3)
                                (concat "\n" res)
                              (propertize res 'face 'font-lock-warning-face)))
                    :rface 'font-lock-doc-face)
#+end_src

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Translate by paragraph and insert each result at the end of source paragraph
  ;; This configuration is suitable for translation work. That is: Translate -> Modify -> Save
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-insert-render :type 'after)))

  ;; Translate the current paragraph and replace it with the translation result
  ;; This configuration is suitable for scenes such as live chat. Type some text, translate it, and send it
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :pick nil)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-insert-render :type 'replace)))

  ;; Translate specific words in current paragraph and insert the result after each word
  ;; This configuration can help in reading articles with some words you don't know
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph
                          :pick 'word
                          :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 6)))
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-insert-render :type 'after
                                   :rfmt " (%s)"
                                   :rface '(:foreground "grey"))))
#+end_src

*** gt-overlay-render

Use Overlays to display translation results.

Set the display mode through =type=:
- =after=, the default type, displays the translation results after the source text
- =replace=, overlays the translation results on top of the source text
- =help-echo=, display result only when the mouse is hovered over the source text
  
It is similar to =gt-insert-render= in many ways, including options:
- =sface=, propertize the source text with this face after the translation is complete
- =rfmt=, the output format of the translation result
- =rface=, specify a face for the translation results
- =pface=, specify a face for the translation prefix (language and engine prompts)

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Translate all paragraphs in buffer and display the results after the original paragraphs in the specified format
  ;; This is a configuration suitable for reading read-only content such as Info, News, etc.
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'after
                                    :sface nil
                                    :rfmt "\n\n%s"
                                    :rface 'font-lock-doc-face)))

  ;; Mark all qualified words in the Buffer and display the translation results when hover over them
  ;; This is a practical configuration, suitable for reading articles that contains unfamiliar words
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'word :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 5)))
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'help-echo
                                    :sface '(:underline (:color "pink" :style wave)))))

  ;; Use overlays to overlay the translated results directly on top of the original text
  ;; Use this configuration for an article to get its general idea quickly
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'replace :rface nil)))
#+end_src

** Customization and Extension

The code is based on eieio (CLOS), so almost every component can be extended or replaced.

For example, implement an engine that outputs the captured text in reverse order. It's easy:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; First, define the class, inherit from gt-engine
  (defclass my-reverse-engine (gt-engine)
    ((delimiter :initform nil)))

  ;; Then, implement the method gt-translate
  (cl-defmethod gt-translate ((_ my-reverse-engine) task next)
    (with-slots (text res) task
      (setf res (cl-loop for c in text collect (reverse c)))
      (funcall next task)))

  ;; At last, config and have a try
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator :engines (my-reverse-engine)))
#+end_src

For example, extend Taker to let it can capture all headlines in org mode:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; [implement] make text slot of Taker support 'org-headline
  (cl-defmethod gt-thing-at-point ((_ (eql 'org-headline)) (_ (eql 'org-mode)))
    (let (bds)
      (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'headline
        (lambda (h)
          (save-excursion
            (goto-char (org-element-property :begin h))
            (skip-chars-forward "* ")
            (push (cons (point) (line-end-position)) bds))))))

  ;; [usage] config Taker with ':text org-headline' and that's it
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator
                               :taker (gt-taker :text 'org-headline)
                               :engines (gt-google-engine)
                               :render (gt-overlay-render :rfmt " (%s)" :sface nil)))
#+end_src

In this way, use your imagination, you can do a lot.

** Miscellaneous

To enable debug, set =gt-debug-p= to t, then you will see the logs in buffer =*gt-log*=.
